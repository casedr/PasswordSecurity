Abstract:
A closer look into the implementation and algorithmic techniques of Password Cracking.

Introduction:
In the branch of Computer Security, understanding the techniques involved in password cracking can lead to an understanding
of how to prevent successful attacks. The goal for this project is to research and implement the various algorithms used
in cracking passwords within a small, commandline-run software package. (Possible GUI to follow.)
