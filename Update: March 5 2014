Update: November 8th, 2013 - CSCE 499 Capstone

This week I have continued my research and practiced various smaller C programs, such as basic File IO. I have also researched more about the implementation of the Brute Force method in password cracking. Next week I plan to implement one of the cryptographic hash functions and have it generate hashes. More code to come.


Update: November 22nd, 2013 - CSCE 499 Capstone

This week I have implemented a version of Blowfish in C that outputs hashes. Code to be posted soon. I plan to now implement
the other encryption algorithms as mentioned in the Requirements Document; SHA-1 and MD5. Requirements document also uploaded.




UPDATE: March 5th, 2014 - CSCE 499 Capstone

Been a while hasn't it? Lot of things have been going on - so here is the update for today.
No longer doing Blowfish - a fiestel cipher is not practical for the project. Thus the implementation that I had wrote
previously will not be posted. (It didn't work well anyway.)

Next up - code for MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2 will be posted soon instead. Also uploaded the current (yet rough) Design Document.
Will be adding to the document and overhauling sections for the final paper due in May. Next goal - get that code commited
and posted Friday, along with the code for the Brute-Force Attack. This will be the focus for the technical presentation
next Tuesday (March 11th).
