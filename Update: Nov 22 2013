Update: November 8th, 2013 - CSCE 499 Capstone

This week I have continued my research and practiced various smaller C programs, such as basic File IO. I have also researched more about the implementation of the Brute Force method in password cracking. Next week I plan to implement one of the cryptographic hash functions and have it generate hashes. More code to come.


Update: November 22nd, 2013 - CSCE 499 Capstone

This week I have implemented a version of Blowfish in C that outputs hashes. Code to be posted soon. I plan to now implement
the other encryption algorithms as mentioned in the Requirements Document; SHA-1 and MD5. Requirements document also uploaded.
