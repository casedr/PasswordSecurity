Update: November 8th, 2013 - CSCE 499 Capstone

This week I have continued my research and practiced various smaller C programs, such as basic File IO. I have also researched more about the implementation of the Brute Force method in password cracking. Next week I plan to implement one of the cryptographic hash functions and have it generate hashes. More code to come.
